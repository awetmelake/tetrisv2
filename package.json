  "description": "JS Tetris clone\r Tetris is one of my favorite games. This is a tetris game made in js using a principle I learned about called MVC (Model View Controller). Its a way of seperating the 3 major components of an app for organized and more easily managble code. This project is seperated into 3 parts: game display and controller, corresponding to the seperate elements of the MVC framework. The order of operations goes like this - the controller  invokes methods within the game that change data such as the values in the 2d array of the board matrix and the orientation of the current peice being controlled by the player, the display file contains the code that draws and updates the visual representaion of this data as its changing.\r # tetrisv2",
